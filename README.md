# Overview
This software tool designed to convert radar-derived coordinates (w, v, u vectors) into standard coordinates (x, y, z vectors) for visual representation and analysis. Additionally, the software integrates Digital Terrain Models (DTM) of a mine to accurately compare the converted data with the ground truth. By detecting displacements, the software dynamically changes the color of areas that have experienced shifts, providing valuable insights for mining and geospatial applications.

## Features
- Efficient conversion of radar data (w, v, u vectors) to standard coordinates (x, y, z vectors).
- Seamless integration with mine Digital Terrain Models (DTM) for accurate displacement analysis.
- Dynamic visualization of displacement through color changes on the 3D surface representation.
- User-friendly interface for easy data loading, conversion, and visualization.
- High-performance computation to handle large datasets effectively.

## Components
- Radar Data Conversion: Converts w, v, u vectors into x, y, z vectors using advanced algorithms.
- Digital Terrain Model (DTM) Loader: Loads and integrates the mine's DTM for displacement analysis.
- 3D Visualization: Provides an interactive 3D view of the mine surface and displaced areas.
- Color Mapping: Dynamically changes the color of displaced regions for clear identification.
- User Interface: An intuitive interface for easy data loading, conversion, and visualization.

## Setup and Usage

#### 1. Data Loading:
- Load radar-derived data with w, v, u vectors into the software.
- Load the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) of the mine for displacement comparison.

#### 2. Data Conversion:
- Utilize the software to convert radar data (w, v, u vectors) to standard coordinates (x, y, z vectors).

#### 3. Displacement Visualization:
- The software compares the converted data with the DTM to identify displacements.
- Visualize displacements on the 3D surface representation, with dynamically changing colors indicating areas that experienced shifts.

#### 4. Data Analysis:
- Analyze the displacements to gain insights into ground movements and structural changes.
- Export displacement data and visualizations for further analysis and reporting.
